- hi I'm overionised, I'm an IT student.
- I use my repos for bigger projects, and personal stuff. It is not neceserally limited to school.
- I like Linux with a wm, only the stable kind of Linux.
- I also indulge in a little bit of bash scripting
     - currently practising pentests with Kali
     - if I make any cool scripts there will probably be a repo
- I made an OS IT'S DONE
     - it's called Neco arc Linux and is exactly what it sounds like.
     - honestly it's: 
        - based on Ubuntu
        - kinda bloated
        - really funny
        - using preconfigured i3 which is cool

- Check it out if you want to, it's a meme os, so have fun with it.

- haha I do not know where to drop the files, so just text me or something. I know right, so professional.
